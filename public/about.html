<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Robert. I am a computer science student at Santa Moncia College, and I am learning to code in HTML.</p>

<p>I have always loved computers. Coding to me seems like going "under the hood" of a car - it's so fascinating to see how everhything works and to create something amazing with code.</p>

<p>My professional background is in the tech industry. I work for a software company called Miro - I'm so fortunate to get to work for a product that I truly love.</p>
